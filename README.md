# Weather Dashboard

## How it works

This weather dashboard fetches weather data from any city in the world, courtesy of the Open Weather API. Users are able to search for a city and retrieve data on the current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast. In addition to the third party API, the website also makes use of JS to facilitate the interactivity and the DOM manipulation.
